    I probably did—
    
    observe one day
    
    the fall of the sun
    and caught the gold that was scattered
    in the palm of the sea
    and enclosed my ribs about
    the last escaping heat
    as I searched for a farewell
    sifting through piles of sand
    
    And I paced the city
    back and forth
    I hung around in the old cafes
    sipping at bottles of beer
    I met with friends and passers-by
    sat with literati and revolutionaries
    and among the crowded tables I spent
    long hours
    
    I went up and down
    streets and discussions
    but I remember that once
    I bought
    from the other end of the street
    a mizmar!
    And I stood under a balcony
    observing wet newspapers
    and the heavy clothes
    shifting my feet
    in a puddle
    making endless circles

    Al-Saddiq Al-Raddi is one of the leading African poets writing in Arabic today. He has gained a wide audience in his native Sudan for his imaginative approach to poetry and for the delicacy and emotional frankness of his lyrics. His poetry has always been concerned with the rich cultural and linguistic diversity of Sudan and its complex history.
    
    Saddiq was born in 1969 and grew up in Omdurman Khartoum where he lived until forced into exile in 2012. From 2006, he was the cultural editor of Al-Sudani newspaper until he was sacked from his position for political reasons (along with 22 other colleagues) in July 2012 during the uprising against the dictatorship of Omar Al-Bashir. Saddiq only escaped imprisonment because, thanks to the miraculous timing of Poetry Parnassus (the world's largest ever gathering of international poets at which Saddiq represented Sudan), he was in the UK when a series of mass arrests took place. He successfully applied for asylum and is now living in London.
    
    Saddiq's first poetry collection Songs of Solitude was published in 1996 (second edition, 1999). He has also published The Sultan's Labyrinth (1996) and The Far Reaches of the Screen... (1999 & 2000); all three collections were published in one volume as Saddiq's collected poems in Cairo in 2009.
    
    One of the six poets taking part in the PTC's first World Poets' Tour in October 2005, Saddiq received a rapturous response from audiences in the UK. In March 2006 he returned to the UK and gave a moving reading at the Poetry Cafe as part of their occasional series 'In Town Tonight' featuring important international poets visiting London. In the autumn of 2006, he was invited to take part in the LitUp festival in Kendal, and he also gave readings in Brighton and at SOAS in London. In 2008 he took part in the second World Poets' Tour.
    
    'Poem of the Nile' was published in The London Review of Books one of the rare occasions the LRB has published poetry translated from Arabic and the first time they featured the work of an African poet. His poems have also been published in Poetry Review and The Times Literary Supplement. This is a real indication of Saddiq's growing status as an important international poet.
    
    Saddiq's involvement with the PTC stimulated his interest in translation. Back in Sudan, he began an innovative project that involved writers in Arabic from northern Sudan collaborating with writers in English from the south to translate each others' work, a project with enormous political significance in divided Sudan and which he later had to abandon because of the serious risks involved. In 2007, he set up the website Sudanese Ink, a showcase for writers from Sudan and beyond.
    
    In 2010 he was invited to take part in the prestigious Poetry International Festival in Rotterdam. He then travelled to the UK for a series of readings alongside Corsino Fortes from Cape Verde. Whilst in London, a party was organised for him at The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology which holds a significant collection of ancient Sudanese artefacts. As a result of the success of this event (and earlier visits to the Petrie in 2005 and 2006), the Petrie Museum made a successful application to ACE for Saddiq to spend time working in the Museum as their poet in residence during the summer of 2012.

    I
    The little boy, playing in bed
    while his wounded mother cooks,
    is throwing little words and circles
    out of the window.
    
    She smiles
    (the whole world lights up)
    he chatters excitedly - What can he see?
    
    There's a monkey at the window -
    behind the door!
    But he is falling
    into darkness.
    And though he never raises a cry
    he holds up his claws - this dark
    stormy
    boy.
    
    II
    
    She never taught him how to cry only how to sing.
    Happy in herself - just as she wished to be -
    she taught him endless space and vastness
    and she calls him: Open-hearted.
    
    Behind him a mountain of metaphors
    in front a river a mouthful of night
    and a train of caravans calling him away.
    (Where is that thread
    that fire
    the skill?)
    
    III
    Running - down an alleyway
    he splashes cooking oil all over his shorts this boy!
    
    He wets himself
    with laughter
    running through Eternity -
    through this alleyway
    this pack of dogs
    the conspiracies of fate!
    
    IV
    The solid front door remembers the hand that made it -
    You are the key -
    and the creak of the universe — it's your sole secret
    You lean your dreams and future against it.
    For its sake you endure the woodworms
    gnawing through your heart
    the reek of damp
    the hammering of enemies and relatives.
    (Long is the absence of light
    that paints things awake -
    Long is the presence of paint!)
    
    You come home exhausted — from wherever you've been
    the wind at your side — just as you wished
    toyed with by traumas.
    
    Once he made necklaces from seashells
    colouring them with his own fairytales
    once he made friends with strange frogs
    - and all the while she's watching him
    from behind the door /from out the window
    (when she runs to pick him up
    he will not raise
    a cry!)
    
    V
    In the forest the lonely one knows all the voices
    beckoned by the eyes of loved ones
    their songs are luring her
    with their tender fingers
    and her own translucent solitude.
    She sits in silence
    close to every thing
    brewing tea
    stirring the porridge.
    
    In the garden
    of a strange home her home
    she welcomes the pots and pans
    to the sounds of morning.
    Scrubbing everything in its proper place
    one eye on the radio
    that calls her to those distant sands
    the desert.
    But her colour flow like a river
    so she can sing….
    And that boy?
    ………. ………….
    In a green forest
    or a red forest
    or a desert
    now who calls him to Eternity?

    Awoken by light, I scratch the glass
    of dreams, and find myself
    stepping free of shadows and silence.
    
    In the distance a star was absorbing
    my tiredness, and itself heading like a pilgrim
    towards you, leaving blank its place in the heavens.
    
    In the green pits of our being our inner
    threads yearn; this radiance, that makes me feel I own
    herds of horses, am as inspired as any knight –
    
    what is its source? Shocked
    into words, I defied the book-burners, the suffocators
    of thought and feeling, all who’d censor and shroud knowledge.
    
    And a violet blossomed fiercely in the bosom of the sky.

    Star Woman,
    the memory of our embrace still lives
    in this bed, adjacent to your dreams
    and desires, and near these handkerchiefs
    drenched in your scent.
    You woke in the dawn
    at three exactly, drowsing,
    still dazed…
    Beneath the sounds of your breathing
    lurks a worry: where is your mirror?
    And this droplet of light
    reflecting a passion
    that found a name for everything…
    
    Under the pillows also, an aroma
    alive and ours – and the long list
    of names we have bestowed
    on this affair. Surely
    a goddess lives there too, the one
    who knows the names of all things.

    Fouad Mohammad Fouad is a Syrian doctor, public health researcher, and poet. He was born in Aleppo in 1961.
    
    In 1980, Fouad was one of a group of younger Syrian writers to participate in the formation of the Aleppo University Conference, a group that made a novel contribution to modern poetry in Syria and the Arab region.
    
    He has published a number of collections of poetry: Taghut al-Kalaam (The Idol of Speech, 1990), Matruk Janiban (Left Aside, 1998), Qal Baydaba (Baydaba Said, 2004) and Ajza' al-Hayawan (TheParts of the Animal, 2010). He participated in a workshop on translation at the International Centre for For Poetry in Marseille, which resulted in the publication in 2002 of a collection entitled Import / Export, Damascus / Marseille. The collection included the work of three Syrian poets and three French poets.
    
    He has published both poems and critical articles in Arabic journals and magazines. Among the conferences in which he has participated are the 'Voices of the Mediterranean' conference on poetry held in France in 2005, the First Cultural Festival for Young Writers held in Algiers in 2009, and the first Conference on the Prose Poem in Cairo in 2010.
    
    In 2007 he participated, along with a group of Egyptian poets, in publishing Muqaddima (Introduction), a journal dedicated to prose poetry.
    
    He's travelled a great deal: desire, curiosity, and his profession have taken him to more than forty countries. This has allowed him to live - in the words of the philosopher, poet, and doctor Avicenna - 'a life that is broad rather than long'. He has written a number of essays on these journeys to be included in a book that will be published in the future.
    
    The circumstances of the war in Syria have forced him to leave Aleppo for Lebanon, where he currently works as visiting professor in the College of Health Sciences at the American University in Beirut.

    Writing is pain.
    
    And the blood that drips down the screen pollutes the atmosphere
    staining the couch with what looks like dried coffee, which we touch with trembling fingers so we don't get infected.
    
    We manage with broken backs as if going to hell seeing dark red - no, brown as well - which deposits a residue like rust in the soul.
    
    We stroke their old heads then turn aside to lick away the tears.
    
    Those who crawl from street to screen leave green traces on the asphalt that spring into bushes of basil; they toss us a flower and die in haste to spare our shame.

No sound save sporadic gunfire from somewhere, then a single shell preceded by a peculiar whistle. Someone is leaving this planet with a dry throat. Aleppo before me black and still. These huge shadows might be trees or childhood goblins or black vapours exhaled by women waiting for children who are already numbers in a news report.
    
    Aleppo. No oud plucked. No 'Swaying Silhouette'. No drinks in The Nightingale. No drinkers. No song.

    Al-Saddiq Al-Raddi is one of the leading African poets writing in Arabic today. He has gained a wide audience in his native Sudan for his imaginative approach to poetry and for the delicacy and emotional frankness of his lyrics. His poetry has always been concerned with the rich cultural and linguistic diversity of Sudan and its complex history.
    
    Saddiq was born in 1969 and grew up in Omdurman Khartoum where he lived until forced into exile in 2012. From 2006, he was the cultural editor of Al-Sudani newspaper until he was sacked from his position for political reasons (along with 22 other colleagues) in July 2012 during the uprising against the dictatorship of Omar Al-Bashir. Saddiq only escaped imprisonment because, thanks to the miraculous timing of Poetry Parnassus (the world's largest ever gathering of international poets at which Saddiq represented Sudan), he was in the UK when a series of mass arrests took place. He successfully applied for asylum and is now living in London.
    
    Saddiq's first poetry collection Songs of Solitude was published in 1996 (second edition, 1999). He has also published The Sultan's Labyrinth (1996) and The Far Reaches of the Screen... (1999 & 2000); all three collections were published in one volume as Saddiq's collected poems in Cairo in 2009.
    
    One of the six poets taking part in the PTC's first World Poets' Tour in October 2005, Saddiq received a rapturous response from audiences in the UK. In March 2006 he returned to the UK and gave a moving reading at the Poetry Cafe as part of their occasional series 'In Town Tonight' featuring important international poets visiting London. In the autumn of 2006, he was invited to take part in the LitUp festival in Kendal, and he also gave readings in Brighton and at SOAS in London. In 2008 he took part in the second World Poets' Tour.
    
    'Poem of the Nile' was published in The London Review of Books one of the rare occasions the LRB has published poetry translated from Arabic and the first time they featured the work of an African poet. His poems have also been published in Poetry Review and The Times Literary Supplement. This is a real indication of Saddiq's growing status as an important international poet.
    
    Saddiq's involvement with the PTC stimulated his interest in translation. Back in Sudan, he began an innovative project that involved writers in Arabic from northern Sudan collaborating with writers in English from the south to translate each others' work, a project with enormous political significance in divided Sudan and which he later had to abandon because of the serious risks involved. In 2007, he set up the website Sudanese Ink, a showcase for writers from Sudan and beyond.
    
    In 2010 he was invited to take part in the prestigious Poetry International Festival in Rotterdam. He then travelled to the UK for a series of readings alongside Corsino Fortes from Cape Verde. Whilst in London, a party was organised for him at The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology which holds a significant collection of ancient Sudanese artefacts. As a result of the success of this event (and earlier visits to the Petrie in 2005 and 2006), the Petrie Museum made a successful application to ACE for Saddiq to spend time working in the Museum as their poet in residence during the summer of 2012.
